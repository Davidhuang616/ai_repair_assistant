# AI Repair Assistant
This is my master graduation project in TU/e industrial design.

## Empowering Sustainability with an AI Powered Troubleshooting Assistant <br /> for Consumer Products
Consumers face challenges in diagnosing and troubleshooting mechanical and electrical problems with consumer products. Existing support resources, such as Youtube videos, manuals and online forums, often lack comprehensiveness and accessibility, leading to frustration and inefficiency in problem solving. An intelligent and user-friendly solution is needed. Advanced natural language processing techniques and large language models have the potential to provide consumers with efficient and easily accessible support for diagnosing and troubleshooting problems with consumer electronics products.

## Prototype design
For exploring how to use AI in repairing consumner electronics, a task was designed for testing the perfromance of the assistant. The task was "troubleshooting and repair the boost function on the probe". The boost function is a feature where user can use the boost button on the right side of the handlebar to swich different accelerating level for boost up their cycling speed. An user interface prototype and physical probe were then designed to let the participants to experience the whole process.

### User interface prototype <br />
* Voiceflow was used to build the conversation flow for the chatbot.

* The chatbot was integrated into the html designed for the experiment using the snippet provided by Voiceflow. <br />
* Check "How to run the prototype" for more information. <br />

### Physical probe <br />
* A replica of an e-bike from a Dutch well-known brand was built for the experiment for participant to experience using the assistant through troubleshooting and repair process.
* The probe was designed specificly for the task of troubleshooting the issue of "boost function" not working
