# AI Repair Assistant
This is my master graduation project in TU/e industrial design.

## Empowering Sustainability with an AI Powered Troubleshooting Assistant for Consumer Products
Consumers face challenges in diagnosing and troubleshooting mechanical and electrical problems with consumer products. Existing support resources, such as Youtube videos, manuals and online forums, often lack comprehensiveness and accessibility, leading to frustration and inefficiency in problem solving. An intelligent and user-friendly solution is needed. Advanced natural language processing techniques and large language models have the potential to provide consumers with efficient and easily accessible support for diagnosing and troubleshooting problems with consumer electronics products.

## Prototype design
1. User interface prototype
Voiceflow was used to build the conversation flow for the chatbot.

Then the chatbot wasa integrated into the html I designed for the experiment. Check "How to run the prototype" for more information.
2. Physical probe
A replica of an e-bike from a Dutch well-known brand was built for the experiment, for participant to experience using the assistant through troubleshooting and repair process.
